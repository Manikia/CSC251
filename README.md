# Bobby Gisselle Angle's Unix Code!

Some sick labs for my Unix class!

## Installation

Git clone this repo, cd into the root folder, and create a './pickles' folder to store executables by typing the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manikia/CSC251.git
cd CSC251
mkdir ./pickles
```

## Usage

```bash
gcc {filename}.c -o pickles/{executable name}
```
